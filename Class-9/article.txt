DOHA, Qatar — After he scored yet another goal and carried France to yet another World Cup victory, Kylian Mbappé raced over to the sideline and held out one finger toward a television camera. As he made a sly grin, he held out another finger and then saluted with both — one for each goal he scored in France’s 3-1 victory over Poland in its round of 16 game on Sunday at Al Thumama Stadium.

It was a moment of brilliance, fun and brashness that exemplified so much about the 23-year-old French superstar who had said he wanted to become a national icon, lead his country to another World Cup title and supplant Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as world player of the year.

“This is the competition of my dreams, and I’m delighted to be here,” Mbappé said on Sunday. “I’ve been preparing for this tournament all through the season physically and mentally. I wanted to be ready, and things have been going well. We’re a long way away from the ultimate objective.”

In the nearly 100 years of the World Cup, only two countries have won titles back to back. Italy did it in 1934 and 1938, before the tournament was a truly global affair. And Brazil, powered by a young Pelé, accomplished the feat in 1958 and 1962.
France wasn’t particularly sharp to start on Sunday, but a goal by Olivier Giroud and two from Mbappé showed off the talent and depth that dispatched a plucky Polish team, clinched a place in the quarterfinals and suggested France might not stop there.
